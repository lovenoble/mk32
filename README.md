# 1. mk32


Hello
Do you mean the boot mode when you say it? Will the entire operating system be restored to default settings?

1. Flashing the Android firmware will reset the system

2. Click System Settings and find Restore Factory Settings. The operation logic is the same as that of an Android phone.


I will send you the Android firmware and operation steps and upgrade software
